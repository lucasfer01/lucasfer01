## About me

I build web products with a **production-grade** mindset: modularity, maintainability, and repeatable delivery.
I work mainly with **TypeScript + React/Next.js (Vite)** and I’m comfortable with **micro-frontend** architectures.
When the scope requires it, I connect the frontend with **Node.js (Fastify/Express)** and data in **PostgreSQL/Prisma**.

My main focus areas:
- **Quality & reliability**: unit testing with **Jest + React Testing Library**, solid coverage, and regression prevention.
- **Delivery**: CI/CD with **GitHub Actions** and **Firebase** deploys (staging + prod).
- **Operations**: observability via **Prometheus metrics** (through `prom-client`) and baseline hardening (headers/rate limiting/NGINX).

## Stack

**Frontend**
- TypeScript, React, Next.js, Vite
- Zustand, React Query
- Formik, React Hook Form
- Tailwind (and/or consistent UI systems)

**Backend**
- Node.js, Fastify, Express
- NGINX (+ Lua for Basic Auth when needed)

**Data**
- PostgreSQL, Prisma

**Testing & Observability**
- Jest, React Testing Library
- Prometheus metrics (`prom-client`)

**DevOps**
- GitHub Actions
- Firebase deploys

## What I’m building / exploring

- 🧩 **Modular architectures**: microfrontends, contracts, and shared types (no drift).
- 🧪 **Serious frontend testing**: patterns for mocking stores/hooks, forms, and complex components.
- 📈 **Signals & operations**: metrics, diagnostics, and baseline hardening from day one.

---

## What I’m looking for

**Mid/Senior** roles (Frontend or Full-Stack) where I can own work end-to-end:
- build features,
- influence architecture,
- ensure quality,
- participate in deploys and operations.
